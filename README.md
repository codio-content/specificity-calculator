# CSS specificity calculator

A tool to calculate the specificity of a css selector.

Forked from : https://github.com/keeganstreet/specificity.keegan.st

Modifications :

- Made responsive via bootstrap.
- Simplified.
- Added possibility to pass the selector via hashbang parameter `#rule=``
(url encode it if it has # signs in it or is too weird)..
